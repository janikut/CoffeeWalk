# CoffeeWalk
App for finding coffee within walking distance. Consumes Foursquare's explore API.

The venues are displayed as pins on a map, with the name and address of each venue appearing in a callout on tap. The venues come from the "Recommended" section of Foursquare's explore API call.

Supported systems:
- iPhone devices running iOS 11 and greater
- all testing has been done on the simulator only

Next steps:
- allow more granular selection of walking time, perhaps through a scrubber
- improve UI of venue detail screen
- localize strings: it's good practice to localize strings, even if currently the app only supports one language
- implement test cases
